  ## Introdution
  This project is a simple weather application, focusing to show how a project like this can be created using tools such as React and Tailwind, and a study project as well. You can use features like [Geolocation API][geolocation-api] to get your current location or just query by yourself any cities you want, and then the weather api, powered by [WeatherAPI](weather-api), will retrive details about the location you search.
